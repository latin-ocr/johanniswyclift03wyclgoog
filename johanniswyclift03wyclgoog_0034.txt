It must he confessed that Wyclifs mind ie as yet astrange
medley: he uses the very methodo which he condemne; be

one finds oneself ‘moving about in worlds not realized,’ and '

forme, at any rate, the attempt to enalyse his meaning breaks
down (eq. Chapter xi. pp. 194-199): the width and variety of
