subject. “'l'hc assumption oi human nature by the Creator
ol it brings us to a point where conception absolutely tuils-
where the light oi imagination goes out-where language
moves without ideas-where all is lost in one vast and vagae
emotion oi awe.” (Archer Butler, Lectores on Ancient Philo·
sophy, vol. i. p. 143.) And again,

“ Our little system have their day;
They have thoir day and caasa to be:
They ara but broken lighta or Thea,
And Thou, 0 Lord, art more than thay.’'

—Tnnnnsora Io Memoriam, Introduction.

lt is not theuto be wondered at if Wyclii's treatise on
the lucarnation leaves the render unsatisfied. 'l'hat he will
riae from it without increased respect and liking for its
author, 1 do not think possible: and to that end the labour

epent upon this edition has been willingly bestowed. No critic
will know better than myself how incompletely the work lias

been done. Aa a distance from librantes oi reference, with other
occupatior which has leit only occasional leisnre ior the work,
and aboye all with knowledge insufficient for an adaquato per-
formanee of my task, l have done what I could.

'Phe zealous cooperationes Mr. Rudolph Beer, oi Vienna,
tha readiness of Mannaricium give me his continual
assistance and highly skilled counsel, the patience and en-
couragement ot Dr. Furnivall have made the task a pleasant
one, and my hearty thanks are here, tendered to them. To the
Provost and Fellows os Oriel Collega sor their exceptional
indulgence intending and prolonging the loan ol their Ma.;
to Mr. R. S. Poole sor several naeinl suggestions, and tor a
skilled opinion on the writing, etc, of the Oriel codex ; to Dr.
Herzbergfraeukel sor bis report on the Vienna Codices3 and
also to various private friends lor loans of books and other
assistance, I also desire to express sincere acknowledgments.
