‘unica communis humanitas est quelibet persona hominis’
(page 11111 10), tc. tha one common Humanity is identical
with any individnal man: again (page 11111111 8) ‘hic com-
munis homo . . . 11111111 singularis homo, omnium hominum
quilibet' Christ is the ‘homo communis‚' 111 1111 11 Man;
hy the incarnation he is obJeotively ‘unicus homo’: hc is
‘eadem communis humanitas que 111 quilibet frater suus’
(page 101, 1111 28). Certainly hero was 1 brace and subtle
affort to give 11111 understanding 1 reason sor the 11111 1111
Christ is one with 111 111 hrethren. It is another conspicuous
instance 11 111· author's desire to 1111 111 11111111111 deep and
solid. He was not content with metaphorical expressions
about membership in Christ; he essays to establish that union ¹
111 1 metaphysical necessity, and to bring it homo to others
as a logical sequence. Different minds will estimato differently
tho vclue 11 1111 attempt; 11111 sew in our day can accept
Wyclii's argument as asettlement 11 111 question, no 1111 who
studies the treatise from 111 author's standpoint will 1111 11

But Wyclit 111 more 111111 scholastic, 1111111111 than a
theoiogical 11111111, in vindicating the reality 11 Christ’s
humanity. At times his style glows, his heart seems 11 throb
beneath 1111 words, as he struggles 11 express tho intensity

nutura is 1 'most precious jeuel‚' ‘absoluta hnmanitas Christi
