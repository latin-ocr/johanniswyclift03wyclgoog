about tha time oi Wyolii's birth revived the great Nominal-
istie controversy. “ Universals, said Oceam, hear thesemo
relation to the infinite number of individuale that signs do to
the things signified. The universal, be it a thought or a
word, ia nothing bnt a sign which by suppositio is belorehand
taken to denote a number oi individua] things, and is thus the
common noun denotiug them all.'' Nou Wyelif was from
the beginning to the end oi his life a thorough Realist, In the
unprinted treatises, De [salamantinam Idale, De Mateta et
Formo, he sets himself to prove and support the Realistio
hypothesis. In our treatise he assumes it as proved and
constantly (v. Iudex IV. Realism, Universals) inveighs against
the ‘doctores signorunr,' ‘uon ponentes universalia praeter
sigma,' ‘negantes universalia' eta, although he nowhere
quotes or names Caeam. indeed, the theory is necessary to
his view oi the lucarnation. The Word, Wyolif says, assumed
Mun, not the person of any individua] of the speeies Man,
nor yet abstraot Humanity, hut Man the ‘res cornruunis' by
virtue os which the individual supposites aro what they are;
assumed Man as he is in the ‘sonna exemplaris‚’ in the Divina
idea. Christ took ou himself in the incarnation the nature
not afa man, or of many men, but the ‘communis humanitas’
oi all men, so that he is at once ‘eommunis homo' and ‘ uniens
homo‚' The Man (ah. xiii). And lest this should seem to place
‘the Mau Christ J esus' at a distance from his brethren 'the sons

ol men,' Wyalis constantly repeats that, to tha Realist, it only ,

bringa Christ nearer, nay, identihes him with other men: sor
the ‘forma' and the ‘formatum' the individual and the uni·
versal, are identiaal. Although he would not deny the extreme
Realistia position ‘universalia ante rem' iu the sense oi
priority in thought and causation, ‘universalia in re’ is Wyolif's
isvourite formula. ‘Every universal is identiaal with eaeh
and all of its supposites' (page 145, line 19). Therelore
