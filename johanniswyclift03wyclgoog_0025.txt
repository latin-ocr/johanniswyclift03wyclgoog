alternative readings of ‘ille’ and ‘ista’ and a few unimportant
variatione in the order of the words. Ihave endeavoured also to
gire the spelling, l mrrst not say the orthography, ol the MSS..
ewen when it is manifestly incorrect, ay. methaphiaico, antli-
tasis, dyabolus. Editions like this, besides their interest to
studente ol theology or philosophy, contributa material also
to tho studente oi language. lt is noticeable in this con-

As to the relative walae of the MSS.,1 think 0 is the best,
as probably it is tha oldest ; bat the contributione 10 a good
