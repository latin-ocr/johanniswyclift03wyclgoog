xiv hauries.

The book is incompleta, having on its last page 'the beginning oi a
tract on the povcrty oi Christ.

The writing varies very much in the volume; some parts being
much clearer and more careful than others. The worat is the De
Iacaraate'one, which is written very hurriedly, with excessivo con·
tractions. The lines are generally croohcd end very cluse together.
Some parta of the first treatise (De Sacerdotio) are almost aa bad.

The relation ol the MS. to the text of our treet is curicus. Very
much is omitted, and the joining words and clauses of sentences are
commonly altered, while cn the other hand long passages are given
verbatim from a good text.

Ι was at first inclined to hope we had here the notes of a pupil who
had heard the De Incaruotione as lecturas, hut 1 now take this copy
to be a summary made from a Me. lor the use of the writer. The
parts copied contain the main course of the argument, the omissione
being chiefly ol illustratione end authorities cited. A listener would
be less choica in his selecticn and less full in the pisces given. More·
over, the hest judgments I can obtain say that the writing is not oi
Wyclii's time, but of the fifteenth century.
