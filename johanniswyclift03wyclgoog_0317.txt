Iluring each of the three years 1887, ’8, ’9, the Gom·
mittee hope that one ol the Society's Editor-s will have
ready either a short Book ol the Summa, or a set of the
Miscellaueous Trentises, so aa to keep the Society's issue up
· to two volumen a year. But as the copying of the Logical
and Philosophicel Works is still going on, more money is
wanted to enable the Society ιο keep up its yearl two
volumes. As time ces ou, lukewarm subscribere fall off,

od friends die. ,file continuere end survivors who 'care
or Wyclil's memory, must show that careby getting fresh
Membere for the society, which hes yet at east teu years’
workhel'ore it, possibly fifteen. Members must look their
undertaking full in the fece, and resolve to ‘put it through.'
